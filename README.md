# Driver-Profile-Classification
Driver Profile Classification thesis repository. This project aims to develop a system that takes advantage of the use of machine learning techniques to
establish a driving profile based on trips data obtained in a non-intrusive way.

Notes
-----

1. It is necessary to have an API token in order to run the script preprocess/a_idreams_pull_trips.py.
2. Because the events are private, they have not been uploaded to the repository so the script preprocess/b_construct_dataset.py does not run.
3. Only one dataset is available to make sure the repository is not overloaded with datasets.
